# Introduction

Wild mushrooms are prized for their unique, savory flavor. Some species, however, are poisonous with some being lethally poisonous. The elusiveness of prized edible mushrooms and the danger inherent with their harvest means some fetch prices upwards of $40/lb in the grocery store.

The lack of universal "rules of thumb" for edibility makes safe mushroom harvest difficult. Foragers are recommended to identify a specimen down to the species level using multiple sources before consuming it. 

This project takes a machine learning approach to solve the problem of identifying edible mushrooms. Around three people die in the United States from mushroom poisoning every year so better identification tools could potentially save lives. To achieve this goal first trends and clusters will be identified using exploratory data analysis. Next, the dimensionality of the dataset will be reduced using unsupervised models to avoid the curse of dimensionality. Unsupervised models will also be used to classify mushrooms as edible or poisonous. Finally, the results from the unsupervised model will be compared with results from a supervised learning model.
